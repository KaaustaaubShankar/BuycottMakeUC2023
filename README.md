# Buycott: An App for Impactful Consumer Choices

## Inspiration
Our journey began with a profound need to empower individuals in their consumer decisions, sparked by a video detailing the Israel-Palestine conflict. Witnessing someone's struggle to align their purchases with their political stance highlighted a gap in the market: the need for a tool to simplify the boycotting process and facilitate well-informed decisions. Boycotting serves as a critical exercise of consumer rights and freedom of expression, and thus, Buycott was conceived.

## What it does
Buycott is a revolutionary application that bridges the gap between consumers and corporate ethics. By scanning a product's barcode, it identifies the parent company and fetches current news articles to ascertain the company's stance on the Israel-Palestine situation. Is the company pro-Israel, pro-Palestine, or neutral? Buycott presents the facts, backed by credible sources, empowering users to make purchasing decisions that align with their beliefs and values.

## How We Built It
Our application marries the sleekness of Flutter with the robustness of Flask. Flutter brings our front-end to life, creating an intuitive user experience, while Flask sits at the backend, interfacing with APIs and harnessing the power of cloud computing. We deployed our backend and NLP model on Google Cloud, ensuring scalable, reliable performance.

## Challenges We Ran Into
Our journey was not without its challenges. As novices in Flutter, we grappled with its intricacies. Deploying our Flask and NLP model to Google Cloud tested our resilience as we navigated server limitations. Bridging the front and back ends was a Herculean task, fraught with errors. Yet, through perseverance, teamwork, and the invaluable guidance from MakeUC mentors, we transformed hurdles into stepping stones.

## Accomplishments We're Proud Of
In just 24 hours, we demystified Dart and Flutter, breathing life into Buycott. Our application stands as a testament to our dedication and our potential to grow. The positive feedback from mentors not only validated our concept but also fueled our passion. As a team, we celebrate our leap from novices to creators, having mastered Google Cloud, NLP models, and the art of mobile application development.

## What We Learned
Buycott's journey was as much about personal growth as it was about product development. We honed our skills in cloud services, machine learning, and mobile development. Beyond the technical skills, we learned the art of collaboration, the strength in diversity, and the power of shared knowledge.

## What's Next for Buycott
Our vision for Buycott transcends the Israel-Palestine issue. We aspire to encompass a myriad of environmental and social concerns, providing users with insights into corporate practices related to pollution, labor rights, product safety, and more. Buycott will evolve into a comprehensive platform, equipping consumers with the knowledge to hold corporations accountable and drive change through conscious consumerism.

Join us in shaping a future where every purchase is a pledge for a better world.
